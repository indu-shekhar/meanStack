# MEAN Stack Application Development Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the step-by-step approach to develop the MEAN stack application as per the assignment requirements. The application will be split into two main parts: the Angular 8 client and the Node.js/Express/MongoDB server.

---

## 1. Project Setup

### 1.1. Initialize Repositories

- Create two directories: `client` (Angular) and `server` (Node.js/Express).
- Initialize Git repositories if required.

### 1.2. Setup Angular 8 Client

- Use Angular CLI to scaffold a new Angular 8 project in the `client` directory.
- Configure proxy if needed for API requests to backend.

### 1.3. Setup Node.js/Express Server

- Initialize a new Node.js project in the `server` directory.
- Install dependencies: Express, Mongoose, CORS, Body-parser, etc.
- Setup MongoDB connection (local or cloud).

---

## 2. Backend Development (Server)

### 2.1. Define Mongoose Schema

- Create a `Person` schema with fields: Name, Age, Gender, Mobile number.

### 2.2. Implement RESTful API Endpoints

- `GET /person` – Fetch all people.
- `POST /person` – Create a new person.
- `PUT /person/:id` – Update a person by ID.
- `DELETE /person/:id` – Delete a person by ID.

### 2.3. Middleware & Error Handling

- Implement error handling for all endpoints.
- Enable CORS for frontend-backend communication.
- Add comments for clarity.

### 2.4. Test API Endpoints

- Use Postman or similar tool to test all endpoints.

---

## 3. Frontend Development (Client)

### 3.1. Generate Components

- ListPeopleComponent – List all people.
- EditPersonComponent – Edit a person.
- DeletePersonComponent – Delete a person (with confirmation).
- AddPersonComponent (optional) – Add a new person.

### 3.2. Create Services

- PersonService – Handles HTTP requests to backend API.

### 3.3. Routing

- Configure Angular routes for each view.

### 3.4. Implement Views

- List view: Table of people with edit/delete buttons.
- Edit view: Form to update person details.
- Delete view: Confirmation and delete action.
- Add view: Form to add a new person.

### 3.5. Error Handling & User Feedback

- Display error messages and success notifications.
- Handle loading states.

### 3.6. Code Comments

- Add comments to explain logic and flow.

---

## 4. Integration

- Connect Angular client to Node.js backend via HTTP.
- Test full workflow: list, add, edit, delete.

---

## 5. Final Testing & Documentation

- Test the application end-to-end.
- Ensure all requirements are met.
- Review and improve code comments.
- Prepare and review documentation (`instruction.md`, `plan.md`).

---

## 6. Delivery

- Ensure both `client` and `server` directories are complete and functional.
- Submit source code and documentation as required.
